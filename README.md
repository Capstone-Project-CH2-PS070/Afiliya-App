Initial Step to Make Afiliya-App
--
Our beginning step in making *Afiliya* was to discuss and plan the design of the app's layout, features, flow, and so on. Initially, our plan was to create an app with many features supporting Indonesian MSMEs and culture, such as *books*, *articles*, *events*, *shop*, *news*, and others. However, after careful consideration both in terms of capabilities and time, we decided to focus on fewer features but can bring useful, fun and interesting experiences to users, such as e-commerce (affiliate) and events. Furthermore, we decided to implement these features on separate layouts to ease the code implementation and provide a more convenient user experience.
